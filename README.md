Hello, my name is Taryne Leach and I am currently in the process of becoming a Full Stack Web Developer. I am enrolled at the Pursuit Fellowship where I am learning both front and back end operations. It is my hope that in the future I can work with a major beauty brand or fragrance brand, those are my passions.
